# High-Performance Secure Data Transfer Engine

A Linux-based, high-throughput, low-latency secure data transfer engine
implemented in C/C++ using TCP/IP sockets, AES encryption, and
performance benchmarking.

## Features
- Client-server architecture (TCP)
- Multi-threaded packet processing (planned)
- AES-based encryption
- Throughput & latency measurement
- Linux system-level optimizations

## Build
```bash
make
